OUR STORY Home Naivasha Children's Shelter believes in the worth of every child, and every child's right to have a safe environment to learn, grow and play. And we believe the very best place for a child is in a family. That's why we work on the streets of Kenya to rescue boys, rehabilitate them, and reunite them with their families.   Our mission is to rescue children from the streets and provide them with the love, care, guidance, and support they need to become productive and responsible members of society.   Our vision is to reduce the number of boys on the streets in Kenya through rehabilitation, education, empowerment, and reintegration with their families.   Our story begins in 1999, when the East African Women's League launched a feeding and teaching program at the YMCA in Naivasha town to help with the growing problem of street children. The project was very successful, but the children still had to leave at the end of the day and sleep on the streets. The ladies continued to reach out to boys living on the streets until 2001, when Debbie Case and Melissa Keng realized their dream of establishing a home for the boys. Ten acres of land and a borehole were donated for construction of a shelter. Case and Keng rallied friends from around the world, and Naivasha Children's Shelter was born.   With the help of many generous friends, Keng and Case were able to build dorms, classrooms, offices, and more.   Today, Eunice Ng'ang'a and Kristen Sayres continue the Shelter legacy with their new approach (should link to the approach page), aimed at rescuing more boys from the streets, and reuniting families.    On any given day, Shelter is home to more than fifty boys who have the opportunity to begin a new life off of the streets as they pursue education, skills training, and are loved and cared for by a team of dedicated teachers and staff.   In addition to education, the boys are given the opportunity to learn important life skills such as animal care, gardening, beadwork, cooking, sports and talent development.   The Shelter is set five kilometers from Naivasha town against cliffs with an amazing view of the lake.
